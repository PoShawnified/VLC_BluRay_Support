# VLC BluRay Support

## Info / Notes
### The install.ps1 script attempts a partial automation of [candela's documented steps](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1886086#post1886086)

The script will download the keydb_xxx.zip file at run time, but a previously downloaded zip can be passed as a param instead. 

Each step is written as a discreet cmdlet that should allow running any step independently. 
## Prep
1. Clone repo
2. Place all .7z and .zip archives (`\*libaacs\*.7z`, `\*bdplus_tables\*.7z`, `vm0.zip`) archives into repo directory
3. Modify parameters with correct file names (or pass updated file names as params at the command-line)

## Execute
1. *AS ADMINISTRATOR*, run PowerShell.exe (or PowerShell_ise.exe)
2. CD into directory
3. Execute: `.\install.ps1 <params>`

## Parameters

`[cmdletbinding()]` is declared but, at this time, only `-Verbose` is supported.

All parameters are optional... If the parameter defaults in the script are correct then no parameters are required and install.ps1 can be run bare. 

*`-Verbose` is, however, recommended.*

  - `-LibAacsArchive` = String, libaacs 7z archive

  - `-BDPlusVM0Archive` = String, vm0 zip file

  - `-BDPlusTablesArchive` = String, bdplus tables 7z file (~1.5Gb)

  - `-BDPlusTablesUpdateArchives` = String Array, one or more bdplus tables archives passed as an array. Script will sort these by name so, if necessary (not usually) rename ascending to alter processing order.

  - `-Language` = String, three-letter language code

  - `-PerUser` = Switch, changes output targets to User locations. Default is system locations
